# Welcome to the Introduction to DAO Workshop Program!

## The aim of this workshop is to teach you how to create an object-oriented data access layer using Java and MySQL. As part of the program, we will create a UserDao class that will allow us to perform operations on the workshop2 database in the users table.

The users table contains the columns id, email, username, and password. By learning how to create this class, you will gain practical knowledge in the areas of OOP and MySQL.

During the workshop, you will have the opportunity to use classes, objects, and SQL to read, delete, and modify data. All of this will be useful in your future projects!

If you want to start working with the project, create a new repository and follow the instructions. It's important to test each new functionality as you go along to ensure that the program is working correctly.

Good luck with learning how to create an object-oriented data access layer!
